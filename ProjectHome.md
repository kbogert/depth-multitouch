A library for detecting multitouch events using only depth-maps, such as those coming from the Kinect.  This project is unfinished and needs to be documented, but I have it working in c, c++, and python.


TODO:
  * Auto background subtraction
  * Bindings (or rewrite) in java
  * Adaptive thresholding rather than having the user specify one
  * Profiling and Performance improvements
  * Better debug visuals
  * Better demo
